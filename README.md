# Temp

_A modern templating engine for Go._

## What is this?

A templating engine for Go. It's inspired by the likes of Laravel's Blade.

## Why yet another templating engine?

Because I feel like templating engines should have syntax that's not only fun to use, but also safe to use.

## What's with the name?

Don't worry, the name will change at some point. This is just an internal name for now.

## Getting started

As the project progresses I'll be writing this part.
